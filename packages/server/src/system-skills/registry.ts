/**
 * Hardcoded registry of system skills.
 *
 * v0.4 ships exactly one system skill (`harness-init`). Rather than
 * parsing YAML frontmatter from SKILL.md at startup (which would drag
 * in a dep and a failure surface for just one entry — see v0.4 spec
 * §A8 Issue 5 decision B), the `name` + `description` are hardcoded
 * here. When we add a second system skill, revisit: if the registry
 * exceeds ~3 entries or needs dynamic metadata, switch to parsing.
 *
 * IDs MUST equal the subdirectory name under `<astack-skills>/skills/`
 * (resolved by `systemSkillsRoot()` in v0.12+ — previously this was
 * `packages/server/system-skills/`). The scanner (A9) uses these IDs
 * as a blacklist to exclude same-named skills from user-imported
 * repos AND from the inline-skill-repo scan, so users cannot
 * accidentally double-expose harness-init through the marketplace UI.
