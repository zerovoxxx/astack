/**
 * Builtin skill repos that SeedService clones on first daemon start.
 *
 * These are **opinionated** picks. Including them here means astack
 * actively distributes these repos to every user's machine. Consequences:
 *
 *   1. Legal: anthropics/skills has Apache-2.0 code alongside
 *      source-available assets (docx/pdf/pptx/xlsx/). Cloning into a
 *      user's workspace counts as distribution if that workspace ends
 *      up in CI / Docker / backups. Users who care should remove the
 *      seed — SeedService respects `seed_decisions.decision = 'removed'`.
 *
 *   2. Maintenance: third-party repos may change license, inject
 *      unexpected content, or disappear. We re-clone on every start,
 *      so that surface is real.
 *
 * Both risks were surfaced in the /plan-eng-review outside-voice pass
 * (see docs/version/Iteration1_SqliteAndMultiRepo_SPEC.md § 2 Known risks
 * accepted) and the user explicitly chose to accept them.
 *
 * Removing a seed from this list mid-life does NOT retract already-
 * cloned copies on existing machines — the user must run
 * `astack repos remove <name>` manually. That writes seed_decisions so
 * the repo won't come back on future starts even if we re-add it here.
