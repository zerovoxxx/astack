/**
 * SeedService — bootstraps three opinionated open-source skill repos
 * on the first daemon start.
 *
 *   ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
 *   │  seedBuiltinRepos() → Promise.allSettled over BUILTIN_SEEDS │
 *   │     for each seed:                                            │
 *   │       - if user already removed it (seed_decisions) → skip   │
 *   │       - if already registered (user did it manually) → skip  │
 *   │       - if prior attempt left a failed / orphan row → clean │
 *   │       - otherwise: RepoService.register(...) with            │
 *   │         kind='open-source' + scan_config = seed.scan_config   │
 *   │  Emit SeedCompleted event with the summary.                  │
 *   └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
 *
 * Non-blocking: callers fire-and-forget this from daemon startup.
 * Failures never bubble up past the service boundary — the dashboard
 * learns about them via the SeedCompleted event's `failed_names`.
 *
 * Retry policy: on every daemon start we re-inspect the state. A seed
 * with status='failed' gets deleted before the retry; a seed with
 * seed_decisions.decision='removed' is respected permanently; a
 * seed that's registered with any other status (ready, seeding) is
 * left alone.
 *
 * See docs/version/Iteration1_SqliteAndMultiRepo_SPEC.md § 2 (accepted risks)
 * and § PR4 for the surrounding design.
